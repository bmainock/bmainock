End of the day I am just a very passionate computer science grad looking for a shot to prove myself.
I've loved computers ever since I found my first LTT video, I love to learn new things and experiment with different concepts and languages.
I have years of support experience in both a formal and informal setting and a working knowledge of hardware to a degreee some might say is overkill.

Thank you for viewing my profile and enjoy what I have pinned.
